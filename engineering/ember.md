# Ember Style Guide

## Test

### [ember-test-selectors](https://github.com/simplabs/ember-test-selectors)

We try to use page objects as much as possible, but if we need to use test-selector directly in the test, import it using the following syntax:

```javascript
import testSelector from 'ember-test-selectors';
```
